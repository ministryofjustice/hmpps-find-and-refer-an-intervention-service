They will work on developing an understanding of how previous trauma links to their current behaviour, self-esteem and general well-being. \n\nIt is not suitable for women. \n\nThis is a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement (RAR) which will look at ways their self-esteem is shaped and how society or personal circumstances influence this. It looks at how they understand and express emotions within relationships and explores support networks, role models and goal-setting. The programme will also look at different thinking styles and communications skills.",
