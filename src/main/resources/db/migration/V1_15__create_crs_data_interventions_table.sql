•	Co-location of Probation staff, and staff from other key agencies, in our Centres
•	Supporting Probation delivery, including Problem Solving Courts
•	Overall co-ordination and support from the GM Women’s Support Alliance.

Having a single women''s specific service is intended to ensure that the interventions are responsive to the specific needs and characteristics of females on probation. The service will be delivered in an environment which is safe and suitable for women, and by staff who are trained in trauma-informed and trauma-responsive approaches and also in women-only group(s) and/or with the option for woman member of the supplier personnel.

Services will be available for women on probation on a community/suspended sentence order with a RAR or on licence/post-sentence supervision. The accommodation and social inclusion ‘mentoring’ service will also be delivered pre-release for those who will be released on licence. 

Appointments which are part of sentence delivery will be enforceable.

A range of approaches will be used including direct delivery of interventions, support and advocacy, and advice and guidance.

The delivery model is separated into six interlinked elements;

•	Local trauma-informed service delivery to vulnerable and marginalised women in safe, women-only spaces, in each Borough in GM. 
•	Co-location of Probation staff, and staff from other key agencies, in our Centres
•	Supporting Probation delivery, including Problem Solving Courts
•	Overall co-ordination and support from the GM Women’s Support Alliance.
•	The development of a network of partner agencies, including new GMWSA associate members, with whom GMWSA will form clear 2-way referral pathways.

The key aims of the Dependency and Recovery Service are to:
· Reduce drug and alcohol related reoffending
· Reduce drug and alcohol related health harms for the offender
· Improve community safety by reducing the risk of drug and alcohol related harms to others.                                                                                                                          

Dependency and Recovery Key Workers will conduct assessments both pre- and post-sentence and will focus on adressing need and minimising risk. There are dedicated consultation clinics in each GM Probation Delivery Unit. The process of ongoing assessment and review will contribute to ensuring that drug and alcohol related health needs are met inclusive of those contributing to offending risk.                                                                                       Specific objectives and appropriate interventions will be determined that take full account of complexity in addressing individual drug and alcohol related need, supporting social (re)integration, and enabling people to lead meaningful and purposeful lives.

Dependency and Recovery Key Workers will have a thorough understanding of the medical and psycho-social interventions provided by specialist substance misuse services and the thresholds and referral pathways for accessing them.
